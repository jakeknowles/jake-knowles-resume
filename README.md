  Senior Android Software Engineer

<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

Software Engineer with 7 years of experience building Android applications, specializing in maps, offline-first architecture, and geospatial data visualization. I enjoy working across the entire app lifecycle—from architecture to release—and believe strongly in cross-functional team collaboration. More than just shipping code, I am passionate about building systems that are easy for other developers to extend and maintain, and I take pride in mentoring teammates, shaping engineering culture, and raising team effectiveness through documentation, async workflows, and shared technical ownership. Always curious to explore new technologies and industries. Looking to join a team where thoughtful engineering and product impact go hand-in-hand.

<h2 align="center">Work Experience</h2>

**Senior Android Software Engineer**  
**Procore Technologies**, Remote  
*Jan 2020 – Present*

Procore Technologies is a leading cloud-based construction management platform used by contractors, owners, and project managers to manage construction projects from planning through completion.  
Unearth Technologies was a map-based software startup acquired by Procore in Sep 2023.

#### Post-Acquisition – Senior Android Software Engineer (Sep 2023 – Present)
- Built Procore’s first Android Maps SDK and rolled it out to 15,000+ construction companies in 6 months — simplified jobsite photo discovery by removing 3 screens/taps, enabling location-based access over static lists.
- Modularized the new Maps SDK and published it as a precompiled .aar package, ensuring the new feature didn’t impact overall app build times — this approach avoided local SDK recompilation and influenced broader modularization efforts across the mobile org.
- Mentored and led a distributed team across a 12-hour time zone gap. Introduced async workflows, instituted code quality standards, and drove a culture of knowledge sharing — improving team velocity, reducing rework, and enabling independent feature delivery across time zones.
- Set up a CircleCI CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and a 60% SonarQube coverage threshold, improving test reliability and enabling integration workflows for the maps mobile team.
- Documented Maps SDK design decisions and architecture tradeoffs, accelerating onboarding and improving cross-team decision-making of map-based systems, and facilitated alignment with Principal and Staff Engineers across Android & iOS teams.
- Maintained the Procore Maps SDK as an internal GitHub repository; authored reusable components, managed releases, and wrote developer-facing documentation for adoption across multiple mobile teams.
  - Tech Stack: Kotlin, MapLibre, Coroutines, LiveData, Flows, Artifactory, Gradle, XML, CircleCI, SpatiaLite, SQL, Room, MVVM, LaunchDarkly, New Relic, Amplitude, JIRA, Figma, Firebase, Robolectric, Espresso, Mockito, JUnit, SonarQube, Confluence

#### Pre-Acquisition – Android Software Engineer III at Unearth Technologies (Jan 2020 – Sep 2023)
- Implemented real-time data syncing via WebSockets (WSS), enabling instant cross-platform updates (Web, iOS, Android) while eliminating client-side polling.
- Built an offline-first architecture with SpatiaLite and spatial queries, supporting seamless map rendering and reliable data storage in low or no-connectivity environments.
- Integrated with Trimble GPS hardware devices, achieving centimeter-level accuracy for geospatial data collection; traveled onsite to diagnose and resolve hardware-related issues.
- Optimized SQL queries by refactoring table schemas and JOIN logic, enabling smooth rendering of data without regressing Mapbox performance.
- Built a filtering system enabling users to toggle data between map and list views, improving data discoverability and UX.
- Led the Android team — mentored developers, ran hiring loops, and owned release and incident response processes. Built confidence and autonomy through hands-on pairing and architectural coaching.
- Sole Android developer at the time of acquisition, responsible for app maintenance and knowledge transfer during the transition to Procore.
  - Tech Stack: Kotlin, RxJava, WebSockets, Mapbox, SpatiaLite, GitHub Actions, Retrofit, XML, JSON, MVP, MVVM, Firebase, JIRA, Invision, Datadog
 
**Lead Android Developer**  
**BaseMap**, Bothell (WA)  
*Jul 2018 – Jan 2020*  

BaseMap is a map-based hunting/hiking/fishing software startup.
- Built a new social media feed with posts, comments, and friend requests, collaborating with product and design to align on user experience and unlock new revenue via ad integrations and partnerships.
- Partnered with stakeholders to implement custom analytics, delivering real-time user behavior insights that shaped product decisions and marketing strategies.
- Led the migration from Java to Kotlin, reducing tech debt and modernizing the architecture to improve maintainability and accelerate onboarding for new team members.
- Promoted to Lead Developer within 8 months, grew the Android team from 1 to 3 engineers, introduced agile workflows, and facilitated sprint planning and retros to improve team velocity and communication.
  - Tech Stack: Java, Kotlin, RxJava, Mapbox, SQLite, Dagger, XML, JSON, Retrofit, MVP, Firebase, JIRA, Invision, Bitbucket, Countly

**Software Engineer**  
**Boeing**, Everett (WA)  
*Mar 2018 – Jun 2018*

Boeing is a global aerospace company.  
Interactive Window (3-month contract)
- Collaborated with UX and hardware teams to develop a POC Android app for interactive airplane windows, contributing to next-gen in-flight entertainment concepts.
  - Tech Stack: Java, REST APIs, Retrofit, JSON, XML

**Software Engineer Intern**  
**Data I/O**, Redmond (WA)  
*Jun 2017 – Feb 2018*

Data I/O is a global provider of advanced data and security programming solutions for flash, microcontrollers, and logic devices.
- Re-engineered a legacy log file collector tool for the PSV7000 device, improving maintainability and enabling better diagnostics for support and QA teams.
